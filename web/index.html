      <h2>Welcome to Beijing West Parking Lot Center</h2>
      <p>
        Beijing West Parking Lot Center is an garage management system built on Huawei LiteOS. It's our first application of Internet of Things. It's device cost is very slow. We use Nucleo as our hardware core, and together we enabled some other modules such as bluetooth, camera.
      </p>
      <p>
        We had this idea because we met some inconveniences during parking. Sometimes we go to a parking lot and it's almost full and hard to find an empty space in it. Many times, people waited a long line to wait for payment one by one.
